&bWelcome to Alpha 1.0.1!&r

In this release I edited many configs so that the modpack will function more like how I imagined it for the release!
There are still things to be worked on, the main menu (and some other menu's) need to get a **BIG** revamp.


# What has changed?

 - Surviving the first couple of nights won't be as difficult as compared to A 1.0.0!
 - Changed out **Spice of life: Carrot Edition** for **Spice of life: Onion Edition**. This means that you need to keep eating more balanced instead of trying out different food. You'll need to get cooking different meals now!
 - Added the magic mod &lMahou Tsukai&r!
 - Changed the recipes for &lSophisticated Backpacks&t!
They won't be as easy too make now!
 - Added a recipe to get &lRose Quartz&r coming
from the &lRose Quartz Chunks&r that you can 
find generating naturally in the nether. 
They finally have a use!
