&lWelcome to Alpha 1.0.1!&r

In this release I edited many configs so that
the modpack will function more like how I imagined
it for the release!
There are still things to be worked on, some menu's
need to get a &lBIG&r revamp.


&lWhat has changed?&r

 - Surviving the first couple of nights won't
be as difficult as compared to A 1.0.0!
 - Changed out &b&lSpice of life: Carrot Edition&r
for &b&lSpice of life: Onion Edition&r. This means
that you need to keep eating more balanced instead
of trying out different food. You'll need to get
cooking different meals now!
 - Added the magic mod &b&lMahou Tsukai&r!
 - Changed the recipes for &b&lSophisticated
Backpacks&t! They won't be as easy too make now!
 - Added a recipe to get &b&lRose Quartz&r coming
from the &b&lRose Quartz Chunks&r that you can 
find generating naturally in the nether. 
They finally have a use!
