&lWelcome to Alpha 1.0.1!&r

In this release I edited many configs so that
the modpack will function more like how I
imagined it for the release!
There are still things to be worked on, some
menu's need to get a &lBIG&r revamp,
quests are worked on etc.


&lWhat has changed?&r

 - Surviving the first couple of nights won't
be as difficult as compared to A 1.0.0!
 - Changed out &b&lSpice of life: Carrot Edition&r
for &b&lSpice of life: Onion Edition&r. This means
that you need to keep eating more balanced
instead of trying out different food. You'll
need to get cooking different meals now!
 - Added the magic mod &b&lMahou Tsukai&r!
 - Changed the recipes for &b&lSophisticated
&b&lBackpacks&r! They won't be as easy
to make now!
 - Added a recipe to get &b&lRose Quartz&r coming
from the &b&lRose Quartz Chunks&r that you can 
find generating naturally in the nether. 
They finally have a use!
